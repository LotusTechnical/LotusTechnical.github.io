        The meaning of the lotus flower comes from the way it grows in nature. It starts as a bud under murky water, and grows until it emerges in a beautiful blooming flower.

        <div class="info-description">
            <p>Lotus Technical closes the gap between job seekers and organizations looking to fill positions in the Engineering, IT and Manufacturing industries. With historically low unemployment rates, organizations spend unnecessary time and cost recruiting, screening, and hiring the right person for the job.   Additionally, many organizations lack the internal resources to find, attract, and retain the right talent. Since 2010, our job has been to connect organizations to top talent and simplify their hiring process.</p>
